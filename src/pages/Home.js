                <h2>Learning More about the Marvel API</h2>
                <p className="lead">This is my attempt at exploiting Marvel Comics API (Application Programming Interface) to learn more about the API and APIs in general.  I'm also hopeful that this will help others to learn more about Marvel and how their API works.
                    I'll add more API queries over time.  This is a work in progress that I plan to continue to add to over time.  However, it's far enough along to be useful.  I hope this is helpful 
                    and maybe a little fun!
